Coding Exercise Instructions:

Write a Hello World program  :arrows_clockwise:
- [ ] The program has 1 current business requirement a write **Hello World**  to the console/screen. 

- [ ] The program should have an API that is separated from the program logic to eventually support mobile applications, web applications, console applications or windows services. 

- [ ] The program should support future enhancements for writing to a database, console application, etc.
    >> Use common design patterns (inheritance, e.g.) to account for these future concerns. 
    >> Use configuration files or another industry standard mechanism for determining where to write the information to. 
    
- [ ] Write unit tests to support the API.

- [ ] Feel free to use a github program to store the coding exercise as I know that’s typically easier to use.
